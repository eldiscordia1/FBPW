FreeBobux is a highly intrusive visual prankware designed to overwhelm the screen with intense flashing lights, rapid color cycling, and persistent fullscreen effects.

Once executed, the program takes over the display and continuously renders high-intensity visual stimuli. Under normal circumstances, the effect will automatically stop after 30 years of continuous runtime.

Users may terminate the prank earlier by restarting the system, logging out, or force-closing the process — if they can manage to do so.

This project is intended for educational, experimental, and entertainment purposes, showcasing persistent UI behavior and extreme visual stress testing.
